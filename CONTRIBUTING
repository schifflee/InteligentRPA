# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are a
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Submitting a patch

1.  It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or
    feature you're intending to fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor,
    it's helpful to know what people are working on. Mention in the initial
    issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be
    assigned to you.

2.  Follow the normal process of [forking] the project, and setup a new branch
    to work in. It's important that each group of changes be done in separate
    branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits
    related to that bug or feature.

3.  All contributions must be licensed MPL 2.0.

4.  Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages] for each change. This
    provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit
    messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.

5.  Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request].
